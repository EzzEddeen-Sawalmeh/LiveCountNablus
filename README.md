📌 Overview
This project uses YOLOv8 object detection to track and count vehicles moving between two defined areas in a live video stream of Nablus (Asira roundabout).
It counts:

Cars going to Asira – Vehicles moving from Al-Ittihad Street to Asira.

Cars going to Al-Ittihad Street – Vehicles moving in the opposite direction.

The user can interactively draw two polygonal areas in the video feed to define the regions of interest.

🎯 Features
Live video stream processing from an .m3u8 source.

YOLOv8 vehicle detection (only cars are tracked).

Interactive region selection using mouse clicks.

Real-time counters for vehicles moving in each direction.

Customizable regions saved for reuse.

🛠 Tech Stack
Python 3.8+

OpenCV – Video processing & drawing.

ultralytics YOLO – Object detection & tracking.
